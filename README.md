# bpmc-fluxus-case

2-part travel case for the DIY BPMC Fluxus DIY kit (rev2). This fits the early model (2017ish), and may or may not be compatible with <https://glitchart.com/shop/fluxus-kit/>.

The idea behind this case is to protect the components in transit, and to provide an easy way to manage the 9v battery power supply. Since the board has no mounting holes, the case is friction-fit. Prints well, great fit, at standard quality on a FlashForge Dreamer.
